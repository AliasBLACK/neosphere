minisphere Changelog
====================

v1.1 - TBD
----------

* minisphere 1.1 is officially BSD licensed!
* Native 64-bit support with the included 64-bit engine! (engine64.exe)
* New "Console" builds of minisphere (console.exe and console64.exe) for
  Windows. This version of the engine displays a console window like a debug
  build (enabling minisphere's Print() function to work), but is fully
  optimized!
* Constructors and properties for all core Sphere objects:
      var sound = new Sound("munch.wav");
      sound.volume = 128;
      sound.play(false);
* Massive performance improvements, both to rendering as well as resource
  loading. Most assets load lightning fast!
* Assert(), a useful debugging tool. Throws an error if the asserted condition
  fails, a no-op otherwise. In the Console build, also gives you the option to
  ignore the failed assert and continue.
* Async(), queues a script to run on the next FlipScreen(). Similar to what
  setTimeout() does in a browser and required for, e.g. compliance with the
  Promises/A+ spec.
* TurboSphere-inspired "Galileo" graphics API, which allows scenes to be
  composed ahead of time using Shape and Group objects.
* TurboSphere-inspired Sockets API, with separate ListeningSocket and
  IOSocket objects. (Legacy sockets are still supported!)
* Built-in MT19937-based random number generator, including a method
  (`RNG.normal`) to generate normally-distributed random values.
* minisphere Runtime, a unified set of system scripts including a cooperative
  threading engine, cutscene engine, the Link query library, and a full-featured
  console, among other goodies!
* The engine now searches <game_dir>/scripts/lib for system scripts.
* API documentation is included in the default distribution.
* Playback position in Sounds can be set with microsecond precision.
* Overhauled FollowPerson() algorithm: Followers move under their own
  power and are affected by obstructions, making the overall effect much
  more pleasing.
* New API functions to manage persons with followers:
      GetPersonLeader()
      GetPersonFollowers()
      GetPersonFollowDistance()
      SetPersonFollowDistance()
* Fixes a ton of bugs discovered since the release of minisphere 1.0.10,
  including a SetPersonScript() crash when passing JS functions.


v1.0.10 - April 16, 2015
------------------------

* Experimental 64-bit engine (needs testing).
* Fixes IsKeyPressed() not recognizing modifier keys on right side of
  keyboard (#20).
* Improves SetPersonFrame compatibility (out-of-range frame is now
  wrapped instead of throwing an error).
* Fixes SetPersonFrame not resetting frame delay timer.
* Fixes a joystick assert error when running minisphere in OS X. (#19)
* Fixes wrong direction being rendered for 4-direction person sprites
  moving diagonally.
* Fixes random deadlocks when playing sounds.
* Adds some API functions from Sphere 1.6+.
