minisphere Changelog
--------------------

v1.1 - TBD

- Fixes a bunch of bugs discovered since the release of
  minisphere 1.0.10, including a SetPersonScript() crash when passing
  JS functions.
- Native 64-bit support with included 64-bit engine! (engine64.exe)
- Constructors and properties for all Sphere engine objects:
      var sound = new Sound("munch.wav");
      sound.volume = 128;
      sound.play(false);
- API documentation now included in the default distribution
- TurboSphere-inspired Sockets API, with separate ListeningSocket and
  IOSocket objects (legacy sockets are still supported :) )
- Overhauled FollowPerson algorithm: Followers move under their own
  power and are affected by obstructions, making the overall effect much
  more pleasing.
- New API functions to manage persons with followers:
     GetPersonLeader()
     GetPersonFollowers()
     GetPersonFollowDistance()
     SetPersonFollowDistance()
