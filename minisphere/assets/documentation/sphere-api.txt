minisphere 1.1 API Documentation
================================

minisphere uses JavaScript for game logic. This is similar to the Sphere
engine, which minisphere is designed to be compatible with.  In fact,
the vast majority of the API is identical to Sphere's, with a handful of
backwards-compatible enhancements.

This file documents the functions exposed by minisphere for use in game
scripts.

Engine Identification APIs
--------------------------

* `GetVersion()`
  Returns the Sphere API version level as a floating point number. When
  called in minisphere 1.1, this function returns `1.5`, indicating API
  compatibility with Sphere 1.5.

* `GetVersionString()`
  Returns the engine's version identification string. minisphere 1.1
  identifies as:
  - 32-bit engine: `v1.5 (compatible; minisphere 1.1)`
  - 64-bit engine: `v1.5 (compatible; minisphere 1.1 x64)`

* `GetExtensions()`
  Returns an array of strings representing the engine's built-in
  capabilities. minisphere currently supports the following extensions:
  - `sphere-legacy-api` - Sphere 1.x API support
  - `minisphere` - minisphere-specific API extensions
  - `frameskip-api` - Standardized APIs for managing frame skipping
  - `set-script-function` - Functions can be passed to SetxxxScript()
