.SH DESCRIPTION
minisphere is a general-purpose game engine which uses JavaScript for game coding.
It is mostly compatible with the Sphere game engine developed by Chad Austin, but is not a fork of that engine.
When run with no arguments, minisphere will display a menu allowing you to choose from a list of installed Sphere games.
You can also pass the name of a
.I .spk
(Sphere game PacKage) file on the command line to launch that game directly.
.PP
When developing a game,
.BR spherun (1)
should be used to start the engine instead of
.BR minisphere .
This enables a number of features useful during game development, such as debugging using
.BR ssj (1)
and engine logging via the
.B \-\-verbose
option.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB\-\-fullscreen
Starts minisphere in fullscreen mode. This is the default when starting the engine using the
.BR minisphere (1)
command.
.IP \fB\-\-window
Starts minisphere in windowed mode.
.IP \fB\-\-frameskip <n>
minisphere skips rendering frames when it can't keep up with a game's requested framerate.
To ensure games remain playable, no more than 5 consecutive frames will be skipped by default.
This option may be used to change the maximum to deal with slow machines; note, however, that games can override the value you provide.
.SH BUGS

.B While not bugs per se, there are some known limitations in minisphere 3.0 compared to Sphere:
.IP \(bu 3
Sphere games using mp3 audio will not run in minisphere.
Due to licensing restrictions, there is no built-in support for mp3.
All known FOSS mp3 decoders are GPL, while minisphere is licensed under 3-clause BSD.
It is therefore impossible to support mp3 out-of-the-box unless minisphere is relicensed under the GPL.
.IP \(bu 3
Compared to Sphere, minisphere is stricter about arguments to engine APIs and will complain if, e.g., a string is passed to a function expecting an integer.
This may prevent some older games from running.
