.SH DESCRIPTION

Nonetheless, as it is designed to be compatible, the command to invoke the engine is
.BR sphere .
.PP
minisphere is officially supported on both Windows and Linux.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP --fullscreen
Starts the engine in fullscreen mode.
.IP --window
Starts the engine in windowed mode. This is the default.
.IP --debug
Instructs minisphere to wait for the
.I ssj(1)
debugger to attach before beginning game execution.
.IP --log <n>
Sets the engine's diagnostic level.
This lets you to see under the hood at the engine's internal operation, which can sometimes illuminate bugs in your game's logic.
If this option is not given, minisphere will only print its version header and whatever output is generated by the game being executed.
.IP --no-throttle
Disable CPU idle throttling.
minisphere tries to minimize its CPU usage, which can sometimes trigger subtle game bugs.
Use this option to disable it temporarily as a debugging aid.
.IP --frameskip <n>
minisphere skips rendering frames when it can't keep up with a game's requested framerate.
To ensure games remain playable, it won't skip more than 5 consecutive frames by default.
Use this option to change the maximum; note, however, that games can override the value you provide.
.IP --version
Displays the version number of this copy of minisphere along with the version numbers of any libraries it depends on.
