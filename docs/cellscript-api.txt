Cellscript API Reference
========================

Cell is a scriptable build system and compiler for Sphere games. Like Sphere
itself, it uses JavaScript to control the build process.  This file documents
the public API used to write build scripts.


Targets
-------

The basic build unit in Cell is a target.  If you've ever used SCons, this is
the same concept.  Targets may either be installed directly or used as input
when building other targets, and Cell will automatically determine the correct
build order at runtime.

files(pattern[, recursive]);

    Constructs a target for every file matching the specified pattern.  File
    targets are unique: They have no sources, and are always considered to be
    up to date.

    `pattern` is a wildcard (e.g. "*.png") combined with an optional SphereFS
    path specifying the directory to be searched.  If 'recursive' is true,
    subdirectories are searched as well.

install(directory, targets);


transpile(directory, sources);
