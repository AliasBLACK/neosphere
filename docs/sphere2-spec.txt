Sphere 2.0 Specification (WIP)
==============================

PART I. SphereFS

SphereFS defines a set of standards that compliant engines must follow to ensure
interoperability of asset filenames between implementations.

SECTION 1. Paths

There is no such thing as a relative path in SphereFS.  To a compliant engine,
a pathname such as 'images/battle/primus.png' is unambiguous: It refers to the
file 'primus.png' in the 'battle' subdirectory of the game's 'images' directory.
This will be true regardless of what context the path is used in.  This is in
stark contrast to older versions of the Sphere engine, where a given path could
be relative to one of a number of subdirectories, depending on the API used.

    1. Paths shall be canonicalized by collapsing './' and '../' components.
    2. When canonicalizing, the path must never be resolved against the physical
       file system.  This ensures consistent behavior for loose games residing
       on disk, even if one of the directories happens to be a symbolic link.
       './' and '../' must be collapsed mechanically.
    3. A path shall not be resolved relative to a subdirectory: for example,
       'battle/primus.png' cannot be interpreted as '~sgm/images/battle/primus.png'.
